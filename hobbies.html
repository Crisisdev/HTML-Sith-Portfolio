      In my free time, I immerse myself in activities that both challenge and
      enhance my connection to the Dark Side. I find great satisfaction in
      lightsaber dueling, constantly refining my combat skills to maintain my
      edge over any adversary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sith alchemy is another passion of mine, where I experiment with dark
      rituals and create powerful artifacts that augment my abilities. Mentoring
      and training new Sith apprentices is a rewarding endeavor, ensuring the
      continuation of our traditions and the strength of our order.
